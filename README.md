# Student-Rank üéì

A comprehensive Python-based student assignment system that optimally allocates students to company groups based on preference rankings. This program implements three distinct assignment algorithms with statistical analysis capabilities, designed for scenarios like internship placements, project assignments, or group formations.

## üéØ Overview

The Student-Rank system addresses the complex problem of fairly assigning students to companies/groups when both parties have preferences. The program:

- **Generates realistic synthetic data** with proper ranking constraints (unique ranks 1-5 per student)
- **Implements three assignment algorithms** with different optimization strategies
- **Provides comprehensive statistical analysis** with multiple performance metrics
- **Supports both batch analysis and single-file processing**
- **Includes a standalone executable** for non-technical users

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Technical Users
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run statistical comparison of all algorithms (20 companies, select top 10)
python ranker2.py --trials 100 --students 50 --total_companies 20 --selected_companies 10

# Generate standalone executable
pyinstaller --onefile --name StudentRanker ranker2.py
```

### For Non-Technical Users
Use the pre-built `StudentRanker.exe` executable:
```bash
# 50% selection rate - balanced competition

## üîß System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Data Generation Engine** (`generate_synthetic_data`)
- **Purpose:** Creates realistic student preference data with proper constraints
- **Features:**
  - Ensures unique rankings 1-5 per student (no duplicates)
  - Remaining companies automatically ranked as 6 (unranked/equal weight)
  - Uses company names from file or generates fake companies
  - Configurable student and company counts

#### 2. **Company Ranking System** (`get_ranked_companies`)
- **Purpose:** Evaluates and ranks companies based on student preferences
- **Algorithm:**
  - **Weighted Scoring:** Rank weights [5,4,3,2,1] for ranks 1-5
  - **Composite Score:** 75% rank score + 25% adjusted score  
  - **Tie-Breaking:** Secondary sort by Rank 1, Rank 2, etc. counts
  - **Final Selection:** Random selection among perfect ties

#### 3. **Assignment Algorithms** (Three distinct strategies)
- **Fill First:** Company-centric sequential optimization
- **Rank First:** Student preference-centric rank-by-rank processing  
- **Best First:** Iterative quality-focused selection

#### 4. **Statistical Analysis Engine** (`collect_algorithm_statistics`)
- **Metrics Collected:**
  - Average student ranking and standard deviation
  - Student satisfaction rates with confidence intervals
  - Detailed choice distribution (counts and percentages)
  - Group size variance and distribution analysis

#### 5. **Progress & Output Management**
- **Real-time Progress:** tqdm-based progress bars (default enabled)
- **Comprehensive CSV Output:** Raw counts and percentage distributions
- **Terminal Output:** Color-coded results with statistical summaries

## üìä Assignment Algorithms Deep Dive

### 1. Fill First Algorithm (`get_student_groups`)
**Philosophy:** Company-centric optimization with sequential processing

**Strategy:**
- Companies processed in reverse ranking order (best companies last)
- Each company group filled completely before moving to next
- Greedy group sizing approach for early allocation

**Selection Process:**
1. **Proposed Company Priority:** Students who proposed this company get automatic selection
2. **Rank-Based Selection:** Lower ranks (higher preference) prioritized
3. **Tie-Breaking:** Higher "remaining rank average" preferred
4. **Complete Filling:** Entire group filled before next company

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ **Guarantees:** Every company gets filled to capacity
- ‚úÖ **Consistency:** Predictable, deterministic results
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-off:** Early companies may get better students
- üìà **Performance:** Fast execution, simple logic

### 2. Rank First Algorithm (`get_rank_first_student_groups`)
**Philosophy:** Student preference-centric with democratic processing

**Strategy:**
- Process all rank-1 preferences first, then rank-2, etc.
- All companies compete simultaneously for students at each rank level
- Progressive filling ensures top preferences honored across all companies

**Selection Process:**
1. **Rank-Level Processing:** All students with rank N processed simultaneously
2. **Forced Placement:** Proposed companies get automatic student placement
3. **Competitive Selection:** Companies compete for remaining students
4. **Progressive Ranks:** Continue through ranks 1‚Üí6 until all groups filled

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ **Student-Focused:** Maximizes fulfillment of top preferences
- ‚úÖ **Democratic:** All companies get equal opportunity at each rank
- ‚úÖ **Fair Distribution:** Prevents early companies from monopolizing good students
- üìà **Performance:** Excellent student satisfaction rates

### 3. Best First Algorithm (`get_best_first_student_groups`)
**Philosophy:** Quality optimization with balanced iterative selection

**Strategy:**
- Each round, every company selects their single best available student
- Continues until all groups are filled
- Balances individual quality with overall fairness

**Selection Process:**
1. **Round-Based:** Each company gets one selection per round
2. **Quality Criteria:** 
   - Automatic selection for proposed company + rank 1 match
   - Otherwise: best combination of low rank + high remaining average
3. **Iterative Filling:** Continues rounds until all positions filled
4. **Balanced Opportunity:** Each company participates in every round

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ **Quality-Focused:** Optimizes for best possible matches
- ‚úÖ **Balanced:** Equal selection opportunity per round
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Variability:** Results can vary based on competition dynamics
- üìà **Performance:** Sophisticated optimization, longer execution

# Executable version (same arguments)
./dist/StudentRanker.exe --trials 50 --students 25 --total_companies 20 --selected_companies 8
```

### üè¢ Company Selection Architecture

The program uses a **two-stage company system** that models realistic competitive scenarios:

#### **Stage 1: Company Pool Generation**
- `--total_companies` defines the **full universe** of companies
- All companies receive student preference rankings
- Larger pools create more realistic preference distributions
- **Default: 20 companies** (provides good statistical diversity)

#### **Stage 2: Competitive Selection**
- `--selected_companies` determines how many **top companies** get students
- Only highest-ranked companies participate in assignments
- Creates competitive pressure and meaningful rankings
- **Default: 10 companies** (50% selection rate)

#### **Selection Rate Impact:**
```bash
# High Competition (20% selection) - Only elite companies get students
--total_companies 50 --selected_companies 10

# Balanced Competition (50% selection) - Moderate competitive pressure  
--total_companies 20 --selected_companies 10

# Low Competition (80% selection) - Most companies get students
--total_companies 15 --selected_companies 12
```

**Research Insight:** Different selection rates reveal how algorithms perform under varying competitive pressures, making this ideal for studying algorithm robustness and fairness.

#### Performance Characteristics:
- **Optimized Execution:** 3.5-9.7x speedup through vectorized operations
- **Memory Efficient:** Processes large datasets without memory issues
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time feedback for long-running analyses
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling with informative messages

### Legacy Mode (Single File Processing)

For processing existing CSV files with student preference data.

#### Legacy Arguments:
- `--file` **(Required)** - Path to input CSV file
- `--type` **(Required)** - Algorithm selection (0, 1, or 2)
- `--students` **(Optional)** - Number of students to process
- `--suppress_terminal_output` **(Optional)** - Minimize output

#### Legacy Example:
```bash
python ranker2.py --file data/form_test_data_cc.csv --type 1 --students 30
```
